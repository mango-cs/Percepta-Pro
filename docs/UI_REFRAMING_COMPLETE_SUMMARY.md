# 🎯 Complete UI Reframing Summary
## From Crisis/Threat Detection → Reputation Intelligence Platform

**Date:** June 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All terminology properly aligned  
**Impact:** System now accurately represents its purpose as a reputation intelligence platform  

---

## 🚫 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

The dashboard was using **misleading security/crisis terminology** that completely misrepresented what Percepta Pro actually does:

### **❌ Problematic Terminology (REMOVED):**
- **"Crisis Detection Center"** → Implied emergency security situations
- **"Critical Threats"** → Suggested physical/cyber security threats  
- **"Threat Velocity"** → Indicated attack progression
- **"Security Measures"** → Implied law enforcement/terrorism concerns
- **"Contact crisis management team"** → Suggested emergency response
- **"Legal consultation for serious threats"** → Implied criminal activity
- **"Assess personnel safety measures"** → Suggested physical danger
- **"Threat Detection"** → Throughout the interface
- **"Crisis Status: CRITICAL"** → Emergency alert language

### **🎯 Reality Check:**
- **Actual Data Source:** YouTube comments about public figures
- **Actual Purpose:** Public sentiment analysis and brand reputation management
- **Actual Users:** PR teams, marketing professionals, brand managers
- **Actual Risks:** Reputation damage, public backlash, negative sentiment
- **NOT:** Physical threats, cyber attacks, criminal activity, law enforcement
